This is the readme for HW 1 for Comp 20

The goal of this project was to create a basic website using the css and html
that we have learned thus far (emphasis on basic)

There are 5 files that make up this website:
	index.html (the "main")
	joker.html
	bio.html
	resume.html
	batman_style.css

Each html file is a different page of the website, and each page of the website
contains links to the other pages

Further work will be done on this project to make it into a functional website
by the end of the semester
